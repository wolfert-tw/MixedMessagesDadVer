# Mixed Messages: Dad Joke Version

## Project plan:
Project includes the following: 
> A system that once invoked will return a message to the console.
> A random number generator for selecting a message to return.
> A set of messages that are matching the selected theme.
I have selected a theme of "Dad" messages, more specifically 'Dad Jokes'.

### Steps:
1. Create an appropriate data structure for the messages to be stored.
2. Create an RNG system for selecting a message.
3. Test the process and the whole return.
